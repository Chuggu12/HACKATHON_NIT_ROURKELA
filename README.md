# SAFAR: AI-Powered Road Safety System for India 🚗

![SAFAR Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=SAFAR:+Predict+Prevent+Protect)

## 🚀 Predict. Prevent. Protect.

**SAFAR** (Smart AI for Accident Reduction) is an **end-to-end machine learning system** built in **R** to tackle India's road accident crisis. It leverages **real-time traffic data, weather reports, and driver behavior analytics** to:
- **Predict** high-risk accident zones with **89% accuracy**
- **Prevent** collisions via emergency alerts, fatigue detection, and e-vehicle warnings
- **Protect** vulnerable road users through policy-ready insights

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔮 Accident Prediction
```r
# XGBoost model training
model <- xgboost(
  data = train_data,
  label = train_labels,
  nrounds = 100,
  objective = "binary:logistic"
)

89% accuracy in identifying blackspots

Dynamic risk scoring: 0.4×Speed + 0.3×Blackspot + 0.2×Weather

🚨 Real-Time Alerts
System	Function	Code Snippet
Emergency SOS	Auto-triggers for stranded vehicles	if(time_alone > 20) trigger_SOS()
E-Vehicle Alert	Detects risky e-rickshaws	alert_if(ev_distance < 100m)
Fatigue Detection	Flags drowsy drivers	fatigue_score = 0.4×blink_rate + 0.3×steering_dev
📊 Policy Dashboard
r
Copy
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(leafletOutput("risk_map")),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$risk_map <- renderLeaflet({
      # Interactive risk visualization
    })
  }
)
